Contributing Guidelines and Style

In order to maintain consistent code, please adhere to the following guidelines:

    The master branch is protected, therefore you should always be working in a branch. Please name the branch IT-feature_name where IT is your initials and feature_name is a brief description of the feature (RP-login_form or RP-mux_stream_controller). Please make sure to follow the capitalization standards.
    When you have completed your updates, push them to your branch, and then open a merge request to development in github.
    Please follow the styleguide for how to format your code.
    We recommend you use WebStorm/VSCode with at least the ESLint plugin installed and configured to auto-fix on save. ESLint can take care of a lot of little mistakes automatically.
